<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Tram-Lite is easy to include in any project, and requires no build tooling!</p>

<h2>script tag</h2>
<p>
	To install, you can include a script tag pointed to <a href="https://unpkg.com">unpkg.com</a> in your
	<code>index.html</code>:

	<tram-code syntax="html" code="<script src='https://unpkg.com/tram-lite@3'></script>"> </tram-code>
</p>

<p>
	This will automatically add all the API method to your javascript project. They are attached to the window object, and
	also available via the <code>TramLite</code> object.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the minified version of the source code, you can point to the minified version at
	<code>src/tram-lite.min.js</code>:

	<tram-code syntax="html" code="<script src='https://unpkg.com/tram-lite@3/src/tram-lite.min.js'></script>">
	</tram-code>
</p>

<h2>types</h2>

<p>
	If you use npm, you can get the type definitions by installing <code>tram-lite</code>, even if you don't use any build
	tooling (make sure this matches your script tag above).
</p>

<tram-code syntax="bash" code=" npm i tram-lite@3 "></tram-code>

<p>
	This will automatically annotate Tram-Lite methods with documentation in your project if you are using a
	Typescript-aware editor (like Visual Studio Code).
</p>
