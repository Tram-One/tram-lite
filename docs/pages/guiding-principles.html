<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>
	The following are principles that motivate the design philosophy around the interface and methods found in the
	Tram-Lite library.
</p>

<h3>1. Not a Framework</h3>
<p>
	Tram-Lite is a <b>library</b>, it is <b>not a framework</b>. As much as possible, users should run and orchestrate
	their own code. In the face of bloat and tradeoffs associated with frameworks, and the difficulty associated with
	learning new syntax and data models, we'd like Tram-Lite to be a simple alternative. With respect to the
	<a href="https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/manifesto">Frameworkless Manifesto</a>, we believe that Tram-Lite
	can be an alternative that offers few tradeoffs, and seamless integration with other libraries or frameworks.
</p>
<p><b> This is the main guiding principle that inspires all others. </b></p>
<h3>2. Defer to native APIs</h3>
<p>
	Tram-Lite should strive to only offer functions when they would offer substantial benefit over native existing
	options. Additionally Tram-Lite aspires to use and work with native web APIs as much as possible, including (namely)
	web-components. As future native APIs evolve (such as custom-element behaviors), we will work to make Tram-Lite work
	with those interfaces.
</p>
<h3>3. Interoperable and optional</h3>
<p>
	Tram-Lite functions should never depend on each other. While we may offer functions that help enable patterns created
	as a side effect of other elements in the Tram-Lite library, they should be functional in an environment where no
	other Tram-Lite functions are being used.
</p>
<h3>4. Favor no-build environments</h3>
<p>
	Tram-Lite's target environment is a basic html file. It should offer everything needed, and let developers build
	immediately, with no other tools or libraries required.
</p>
<p>
	While many frameworks will recommend generators or platforms for an optimal development experience, we should strive
	to make the HTML and vanilla javascript experience ideal, where only a static web host may be available.
</p>
<p>
	To this end, while we should be interoperable with other libraries, we should not be totally contingent on other
	libraries to provide a delightful experience.
</p>
<p>
	<em> Additionally, as much as possible, this project should try to adhere to this principle as much as possible. </em>
</p>
