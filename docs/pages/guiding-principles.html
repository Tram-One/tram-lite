<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>
	The following are principles that motivate the design philosophy around the interface and methods found in the
	Tram-Lite library.
</p>

<h3>1. Provide an HTML Experience First</h3>
<p>
	While Javascript is a very powerful tool, the current interfaces around web component definitions requires familiarity
	with concepts like classes, state management, lifecycles events, and more. Libraries like React have considerably
	raised the technical floor for would-be developers in the Frontend space.
</p>
<p>
	We believe that a native HTML interface will enable more developers to enter the frontend space, and should allow
	developers to progressively learn Frontend technologies and concepts, without first requiring a strong javascript
	foundation.
</p>
<h3>2. Interoperability with Native Interfaces</h3>
<p>
	Tram-Lite aspires to use and work with native web interfaces as much as possible, including web components, element
	attributes, and custom events. Should always be interoperable with these interfaces, whether they are coming from
	Tram-Lite, or some other source.
</p>
<h3>3. Favor No-Build Environments</h3>
<p>
	Tram-Lite's target environment is a basic html file. It should offer everything needed, and let developers build
	immediately, with no other tools or libraries required. While many frameworks will recommend generators or platforms
	for an optimal development experience, we should strive to make the HTML and vanilla javascript experience ideal,
	where only a static web host may be available.
</p>
<h3>4. Not a Framework</h3>
<p>
	Tram-Lite is a <b>library</b>, it is <b>not a framework</b>. As much as possible, users should run and orchestrate
	their own code. In the face of bloat and tradeoffs associated with frameworks, and the difficulty associated with
	learning new syntax and data models, we'd like Tram-Lite to be a simple alternative. With respect to the
	<a href="https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/manifesto">Frameworkless Manifesto</a>, we believe that Tram-Lite
	can be an alternative that offers few tradeoffs, and seamless integration with other libraries or frameworks.
