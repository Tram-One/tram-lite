<h2>Migration Guide</h2>
<p>
	This page goes over all the major breaking changes between different versions of Tram-Lite. While upgrading is never
	required, if you want to make use of newer features in your old projects, this should help! If you need any help
	following this guide, or if there is a case that isn't covered, feel free to join the discord and reach out!

<h3>Breaking changes in Version 5</h3>
<p>If you are upgrading from version 4, here are the key breaking changes you'll need to fix to go to version 5</p>

<p>Removed Node Support. If you have a compelling use case here, please reach out!</p>

<p>
	Removed shadowRootProcessors on base HTMLElement. If you were using a shadowRootProcessor on a non-Tram-Lite component
	(like <code>tl-effect</code> or <code>tl-controlled</code>) these will no longer work by default. In order to keep
	this behavior, you can run
	<code>TramLite.appendShadowRootProcessor('[tl-effect]', ComponentEffect, HTMLElement);</code>
</p>

<p>
	Changed <code>tl-hostattr</code> and <code>tl-targetattr</code> to <code>tl-attrmap</code>. This should allow users to
	map multiple attributes in a single input. You will not be able to map attribute with a <code>:</code> in their name,
	if that was something you were doing before.
</p>

<h3>Breaking changes in Version 4</h3>
<p>If you are upgrading from version 3, here are the key breaking changes you'll need to fix to go to version 4</p>

<p>
	Places where you had <tag-code tag="template" attribute='is="component-definition"'></tag-code> should now be
	<tag-code tag="template" attribute="tl-definition"></tag-code>
</p>

<p>
	Script tags now need the attribute <code>tl-effect</code>. Script tags that referenced external sources will no longer
	work. See this <a href="https://github.com/Tram-One/tram-lite/issues/44">github issue</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Removed <code>html</code> and <code>svg</code> functions. There are no substitutes for this API in v4. If you still
	need this functionality, you can recreate it by creating an element and setting the <code>innerHTML</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Top-level functions like <code>define</code>, <code>updateRootAttr</code>, and <code>addAttributeListener</code> were
	moved to static methods in the <code>TramLite</code> class. You should be able to call the new methods off the
	<code>TramLite</code> class, e.g. <code>TramLite.define</code>.
