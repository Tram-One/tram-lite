	We have a print-and-fold booklet for Tram-Lite. This is very much a work in progress, and if you have any feedback,
	please share in the discord linked above!

	alt="Book Cover like image, the top says in italics, HTML-First Declarative Interface for building Web-Components. There is a large title, Tram-Lite Micro Guide. Below that is a banner that says, Version 4 point x. To the right is a highly detailed grayscale sketch of a stubby bird on a branch wearing shades and a visor. "

	<strong>Bonus Tip!</strong> For a true booklet experience, staple the seams between the first and second page to the
	other side of the booklet. This will close off the two blank pages, and should create a consistent left-to-right
	reading experience.
