	We have a print-and-fold booklet for Tram-Lite. This is very much a work in progress, and if you have any feedback,
	please share in the discord linked above!

	alt="Book Cover like image, the top says in italics, HTML-First Declarative Interface for building Web Components. There is a large title, Tram-Lite Micro Guide. Below that is a banner that says, Version 4 point x. To the right is a highly detailed grayscale sketch of a stubby bird on a branch wearing shades and a visor. "

	<strong>Bonus Tip!</strong> For a true booklet experience, staple on the black bars between the first and second page
	to the other side of the booklet. This will close off the two blank pages, and should create a consistent
	left-to-right reading experience.
